## What it takes to Manage a Supply Chain

### Two Dimensions

- Multiple Levels of Functionality --> Layers
- Scopes

### How systems vendors have responded

- Fragmentation, banana slide (w/o WES)
- Why is it like this? How did we get here?
  - Very complex domains: Intersection between Physical and Information Worlds
  - Multiple Technologies
  - Siloed, Top-Down planning paradigm (will come back to that)
  - In SC, unlike in manufacturing there was less pressure to reduce inventory levels

### What is happening now

- E-commerce, JIT/Lean
- Multi-Enterprise Supply Chains/Networks (Jarillo?)

### What does it look like to execute with the current systems

- Collect-Forecast-Transmit-Batch-Plan-...
- Bullwhip effect
- This is called *Push* operations because it "pushes" products downstream in the supply chain. It is also a "fire and forget" top-down approach
  - Reasonable when feedback information is not available or too expensive
  - It has terrible control properties where an error in measurement gets multiplied by 20-100x in delays and late shipments.

### So, What to do?

- Operations need to be "reactive" to conditions on the ground.
- To do that you need "real-time" signals to inform decision making
- Decision making needs to be agile and local but aligned with global goals and priorities
- ==> Switch:
  - From "Vertical Tasks" to "Horizontal Signals"
  - From Pushing a plan to being Pulled by Demand
  - Waveless or continuous fulfillment instead of waved/batched
- Some companies & solutions are already well underway
  - Amazon
  - Fortna
  - Not new in manufacturing (JIT supply chains like Toyota pioneered)

- But confined to "single company" scope

#### Extending it to Multi-Enterprise Networks

More trouble ahead:

- Public/Private information
- Outdated & Broken data exchange standards (EDI)
- Data Quality
- Patchwork of 3rd parties

### Some encouraging trends:

- Emergence of WES (banana + WES)

Modern WES vendors:

- GreyOrange

Technology Enabled Providers

- Shipbob, Shipmonk, ...
- Convoy, Uber Freight, Cargomatic

Networked solutions

- Banyan, Cargomatic

Emerging Standards: DCSA

Adoption of technology

- Flexible Automation (easier to integrate in pull operations, already sensor rich)
- Cloud systems (ease of interconnection) & Modern API's
- AI Applications
  - De-noise data
  - "Upscale" protocols from human materials to machine readable
  - Speed of interconnection/integration of systems
