- Table I.1: Last Column Timeframe: ~~2010s~~ ==> Early 2020's We may want to adjust the timeline a little bit or change the wording in the "The Four Industrial Revolutions" first paragraph that claims that the 4th is ending and starting the 5th, when in the table we only give the 4th a time of 2020's, which is now...

- Warehouse Automation 3.0: Maybe a nitpick -->  ~~In that year, Statista reported~~ ==> ~Statista reports that in that year~ ==> I am not sure Statista was a thing in 2010, it reports _today_ what the numbers were on that date, but not sure the report was available back then.
