## Content

The movements/operations layer of the supply chain describes individual actions that move and handle cargo. It is closely aligned with the common understanding of what *Logistics* is. From Investopedia[@LogisticsWhatIt]:

> Logistics refers to the overall process of managing how resources are acquired, stored, and transported to their final destination

The contribution of this layer to the overall value of a supply chain is to resolve the problems involved in moving, storing and processing these resources or goods from their origin to their destination.

in supply chains. They treat the targets of those actions mostly as "opaque" items. A central example of such action is to move a sealed ocean container from one port to another or load/unload the container onto the ship. It may involve grouping/ungrouping cargo elements into other units (e.g. de-palletizing cases for retail) or it may also refer to legal or administrative actions like inspecting a container, clearing customs.
