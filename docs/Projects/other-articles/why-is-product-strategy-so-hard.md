title: Why is product strategy so hard
---

{{ draftMark }}

## The goal of product strategy is to…

Well, that is the problem right there, there is no single goal for a product strategy effort, over the years I have found a myriad variations of statements like:
(People, Process, Product, Technology)

… determine priorities in the allocation of R&D budgets based on objective facts and rational decisions
… balance the short term fire-fighting in product development with long term vision and goals
… motivate the engineers/developers/makers with a clear goal and north start for their work
… consolidate all product roadmaps and present them in a concise way to the C-suite and the board
… map the long term evolution of the technology in the company

Which, in summary, requires that at a minimum, Product Strategy incorporates the inputs and demands of the four biggies in Product and Technology development: People, Process, Product and Technology
If we are to retain our sanity as practitioners, it is useful to first know what the goals are in each of these categories and then find the tools that will help us get there.

## People

## Product

## Process

## Technology
