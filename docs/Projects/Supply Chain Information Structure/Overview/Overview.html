<h2 id="the-challenge-of-understanding-supply-chains">The challenge of
understanding supply chains</h2>
<p>The definition of “Supply Chain” is fairly well understood as some
variation of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Linked set of resources and processes between multiple tiers of
developers that begins with the sourcing of products and services and
extends through the design, development, manufacturing, processing,
handling, and delivery of products and services to the acquirer. (From
NIST: <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/supply_chain">supply
chain - Glossary</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking this definition at heart implies that Supply Chain Management
requires a widely broad set of disciplines and technologies that include
fabrication and automation technologies, transportation and logistics,
operations research, commercial contracts, import/export regulations,
warehouse management, financing, etc…</p>
<p>It should not be a surprise that Supply Chain practitioners and
Supply Chain Management (SCM) Vendors adopt narrower definitions or
specialize in a particular aspect of it. A quick survey of the systems
that touch activities associated with Supply Chains shows a true
alphabet soup of acronyms like CMMS, WCS, WMS, SCM, TMS, etc. which
reflects the very fragmented way supply chains are analyzed.</p>
<p>This fragmentation, while it has always been a problem, was overcome
by dedicated professionals that would bridge the different aspects of a
supply chain, or by ad-hoc integrations between information systems for
particular companies and industries. Either solution was adequate when
the timelines from orders or forecasts to delivered products were
measured in weeks or even months and the value of a delivery was large
enough to offset the costs of the required coordination. Two
developments in the last ten years have upended this balance. E-commerce
drives shrinking order-to-delivery lead times and a “long-tail” of
product offerings, which makes it literally impossible to run
traditional supply chain optimization systems based on a defined demand.
Applying the “Lean Revolution” to supply chains requires a dramatic
reduction of the levels of inventory that are considered acceptable,
exposing supply chains to shortages and bottlenecks as they were
experienced during the Covid pandemic.</p>
<p>In this new world, managing supply chains through a collection of
systems that are integrated through legacy protocols (e.g. EDI standards
dating back fifty years) is quickly becoming a losing proposition. In
response to this, some industry groups and regulatory bodies are
starting to propose more modern integration models like those proposed
by the <a href="https://dcsa.org/"><em>Digital Container Shipping
Association</em></a> (DCSA).</p>
<h2 id="is-it-impossible">Is it impossible?</h2>
<p>The ambitious goal of creating a comprehensive, detailed description
of supply chains may well be an impossible dream, at least for now. The
difficulty of the problem should temper expectations of what standards
can deliver. An overall, extensible framework of concepts and their
associated structure should enable further progress and constructive
collaboration. This approach is the one that the Open Systems
Interconnect (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model"><em>OSI
model - Wikipedia</em></a>) seven layer model form ISO (the actual
standard can be downloaded from <a
href="http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/s020269_ISO_IEC_7498-1_1994(E).zip"><em>ISO/IEC
standard 7498-1:1994</em></a>) took with great success in the
telecommunications industry. This article proposes a similar model to
understand and describe Supply Chains, which we intend to put to the
test in follow up articles for the different layers and specialized
aspects of those layers. It would be presumptuous to pretend that this
first attempt gets everything or even most things right from the
beginning. This article will be updated as we learn more and explore the
different layers in later articles and hopefully enrich them with
readers’ comments and contributions.</p>
<h2 id="five-layers-of-supply-chain-operations">Five Layers of Supply
Chain Operations</h2>
<p>Similarly to telecommunication networks, supply chain networks and
their behaviors can be approached from different viewpoints,
furthermore, these viewpoints can be structured in a way that they build
on each other to create a complete picture of Supply Chain
operations.</p>
<p>The physical elements of a supply chain are the tangible parts that
can be seen and touched like trucks, ships, warehouses, and other
physical infrastructure. Together with other commercial and legal
<strong>Assets</strong>, they are the foundation of the supply chain.
The main operations in a supply chain are all about moving and storing
wares and merchandise. Using assets as resources to perform these
operations is the focus of a <strong>Movements</strong> layer that
defines potential, planned and actual actions that Supply Chains
perform. These actions are performed to make <strong>Goods</strong>
available were they are needed. The goods layer will include the
description of those goods and their end-to-end movement and
transformation very much similar to how layer four of telecom networks
(the transport layer) defines how data packages are sent end-to-end in a
network regardless of the hops and routes they need to take, or in how
many frames the transmission takes place. Goods are moved and
transferred to service specific commercial
<strong>Transactions</strong>. Transactions themselves will be
represented by a number of documents (BOL’s, Purchase Orders, etc..) and
sub-transactions. Finally, Transactions take place between
<strong>Parties</strong> in the supply chain and are performed within
the rules set by <strong>Contracts</strong> and regulations.</p>
<p>The following table provides a summary of each layer. Following the
lead of the OSI model, each layer defines a set of concepts in that
layer, in addition, supply chains explicitly refer to networks of people
and activities (see references below). Each layer is associated with
business functions that are the most interested in the concepts and
processes it defines.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="assets">Assets</h2>
<p>The Asset layer is concerned with the Operation, Administration and
Management of resources that are needed in Supply Chain Operations.
These functions include (again, following the Telecommunications
industry lead):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fault Management: Detect, Diagnose, Isolate and repair faults in
assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Configuration: Provision, Configure and maintain the information
for an asset so that it is readily available for use and can be
accounted for properly by its owners, operators, lessees, etc. It
critically includes managing asset identifiers like container numbers,
vessel IMO’s, Vehicle identification numbers, license plates,
etc…</p></li>
<li><p>Accounting: Keep track of investment, costs, etc… associated with
each asset and groups of assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance: Define, monitor and report metrics for the
performance of assets.</p></li>
<li><p>Security: Manage and track the access and permissions for each
asset, critical in establishing chain of custody auditability, fraud
prevention and for certain sensitive operations in international or
regulated trade.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Assets can be physical assets like a vehicle, a warehouse (facility)
or a piece of automation equipment, legal assets like rights to routes
or landing slots in airports, informational assets themselves like
catalog information for SKU’s or commercial assets like Vendors,
Insurers, etc…</p>
<h3 id="movementsoperations">Movements/Operations</h3>
<p>The movements/operations layer focuses on the individual actions that
are performed in supply chains. They treat the targets of those actions
mostly as “opaque” items. A central example of such action is to move a
sealed ocean container from one port to another or load/unload the
container onto the ship. It may involve grouping/ungrouping cargo
elements into other units (e.g. de-palletizing cases for retail) or it
may also refer to legal or administrative actions like inspecting a
container, clearing customs.</p>
<h3 id="goods-shipments">Goods &amp; Shipments</h3>
<p>This layer’s main purpose is to describe the movement of goods
between two facilities, regardless of how those goods are packaged
(e.g. they can be multiple truckloads or partial truckloads) or the
specific operations that may be performed in the process. E.g. a
Shipment is only concerned about the Shipping/Receiving activities, and
not whether the movement is done through a single truck that travels
directly, or through a series of LTL loads with intermediate
cross-docking transfers. Although this example is taken from common
trucking operations, the concept applies equally to automated transfer
of goods within a warehouse or international trade. The unit of shipment
may be different, but the focus on end-to-end movement of goods, and the
identification of those goods is what is important.</p>
<h3 id="transactions">Transactions</h3>
<p>Transactions are the commercial agreements that govern specific
exchanges of goods and their associated shipments. These agreements are
codified in well defined and regulated sets of documents with specific
legal responsibilities. Orders (sales and purchase), when settled,
represent the change of ownership of goods, BOL’s and their lifecycle
represent the change of custody of the affected goods, etc…</p>
<h3 id="parties-and-contracts">Parties and Contracts</h3>
<p>The final layer also represents commercial agreements between legal
entities (Parties), but in this case these agreements describe the
framework under which transactions are defined and executed. Contracts
may define terms and conditions of payment between two parties that
apply to all orders between them, etc… By extension, legal frameworks
that govern transactions in a jurisdiction would also be included in
this layer.</p>
