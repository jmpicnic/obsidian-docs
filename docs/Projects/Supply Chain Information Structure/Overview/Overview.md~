## The challenge of understanding supply chains

The definition of "Supply Chain" is fairly well understood as some
variation of:

> *Linked set of resources and processes between multiple tiers of
> developers that begins with the sourcing of products and services and
> extends through the design, development, manufacturing, processing,
> handling, and delivery of products and services to the acquirer.
> (From NIST: [supply chain - Glossary](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/supply_chain) )

Taking this definition at heart implies that Supply Chain Management
requires a widely broad set of disciplines and technologies that include
fabrication and automation technologies, transportation and logistics,
operations research, commercial contracts, import/export regulations,
warehouse management, financing, etc...

It should not be a surprise that Supply Chain practitioners and Supply
Chain Management (SCM) Vendors adopt narrower definitions or specialize
in a particular aspect of it. A quick survey of the systems that touch
activities associated with Supply Chains shows a true alphabet soup of
acronyms like CMMS, WCS, WMS, SCM, TMS, etc. which reflects the very
fragmented way supply chains are analyzed.

This fragmentation, while it has always been a problem, was overcome by
dedicated professionals that would bridge the different aspects of a
supply chain, or by ad-hoc integrations between information systems for
particular companies and industries. Either solution was adequate when
the timelines from orders or forecasts to delivered products were
measured in weeks or even months and the value of a delivery was large
enough to offset the costs of the required coordination. Two
developments in the last ten years have upended this balance. E-commerce
drives shrinking order-to-delivery lead times and a "long-tail" of
product offerings, which makes it literally impossible to run
traditional supply chain optimization systems based on a defined demand.
Applying the "Lean Revolution" to supply chains requires a dramatic
reduction of the levels of inventory that are considered acceptable,
exposing supply chains to shortages and bottlenecks as they were
experienced during the Covid pandemic.

In this new world, managing supply chains through a collection of
systems that are integrated through legacy protocols (e.g. EDI standards
dating back fifty years) is quickly becoming a losing proposition. In
response to this, some industry groups and regulatory bodies are
starting to propose more modern integration models like those proposed
by the [*Digital Container Shipping Association*](https://dcsa.org/)
(DCSA).

[]{#anchor-2}Is it impossible?

The ambitious goal of creating a comprehensive, detailed description of
supply chains may well be an impossible dream, at least for now. The
difficulty of the problem should temper expectations of what standards
can deliver. An overall, extensible framework of concepts and their
associated structure should enable further progress and constructive
collaboration. This approach is the one that the Open Systems
Interconnect ([*OSI model -
Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)) seven layer model
form ISO (the actual standard can be downloaded from [*ISO/IEC standard
7498-1:1994*](http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/s020269_ISO_IEC_7498-1_1994(E).zip))
took with great success in the telecommunications industry. This article
proposes a similar model to understand and describe Supply Chains, which
we intend to put to the test in follow up articles for the different
layers and specialized aspects of those layers. It would be presumptuous
to pretend that this first attempt gets everything or even most things
right from the beginning. This article will be updated as we learn more
and explore the different layers in later articles and hopefully enrich
them with readers' comments and contributions.

[]{#anchor-3}Five Layers of Supply Chain Operations

Similarly to telecommunication networks, supply chain networks and their
behaviors can be approached from different viewpoints, furthermore,
these viewpoints can be structured in a way that they build on each
other to create a complete picture of Supply Chain operations.

The physical elements of a supply chain are the tangible parts that can
be seen and touched like trucks, ships, warehouses, and other physical
infrastructure. Together with other commercial and legal **Assets**,
they are the foundation of the supply chain. The main operations in a
supply chain are all about moving and storing wares and merchandise.
Using assets as resources to perform these operations is the focus of a
**Movements** layer that defines potential, planned and actual actions
that Supply Chains perform. These actions are performed to make
**Goods** available were they are needed. The goods layer will include
the description of those goods and their end-to-end movement and
transformation very much similar to how layer four of telecom networks
(the transport layer) defines how data packages are sent end-to-end in a
network regardless of the hops and routes they need to take, or in how
many frames the transmission takes place. Goods are moved and
transferred to service specific commercial **Transactions**.
Transactions themselves will be represented by a number of documents
(BOL's, Purchase Orders, etc..) and sub-transactions. Finally,
Transactions take place between **Parties** in the supply chain and are
performed within the rules set by **Contracts **and regulations.

The following table provides a summary of each layer. Following the lead
of the OSI model, each layer defines a set of concepts in that layer, in
addition, supply chains explicitly refer to networks of people and
activities (see references below). Each layer is associated with
business functions that are the most interested in the concepts and
processes it defines.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

[]{#anchor-4}Assets

The Asset layer is concerned with the Operation, Administration and
Management of resources that are needed in Supply Chain Operations.
These functions include (again, following the Telecommunications
industry lead):

-   Fault Management: Detect, Diagnose, Isolate and repair faults in
    > assets.

-   Configuration: Provision, Configure and maintain the information for
    > an asset so that it is readily available for use and can be
    > accounted for properly by its owners, operators, lessees, etc. It
    > critically includes managing asset identifiers like container
    > numbers, vessel IMO's, Vehicle identification numbers, license
    > plates, etc...

-   Accounting: Keep track of investment, costs, etc... associated with
    > each asset and groups of assets.

-   Performance: Define, monitor and report metrics for the performance
    > of assets.

-   Security: Manage and track the access and permissions for each
    > asset, critical in establishing chain of custody auditability,
    > fraud prevention and for certain sensitive operations in
    > international or regulated trade.

Assets can be physical assets like a vehicle, a warehouse (facility) or
a piece of automation equipment, legal assets like rights to routes or
landing slots in airports, informational assets themselves like catalog
information for SKU's or commercial assets like Vendors, Insurers,
etc...

[]{#anchor-5}Movements/Operations

The movements/operations layer focuses on the individual actions that
are performed in supply chains. They treat the targets of those actions
mostly as "opaque" items. A central example of such action is to move a
sealed ocean container from one port to another or load/unload the
container onto the ship. It may involve grouping/ungrouping cargo
elements into other units (e.g. de-palletizing cases for retail) or it
may also refer to legal or administrative actions like inspecting a
container, clearing customs.

[]{#anchor-6}Goods & Shipments

This layer's main purpose is to describe the movement of goods between
two facilities, regardless of how those goods are packaged (e.g. they
can be multiple truckloads or partial truckloads) or the specific
operations that may be performed in the process. E.g. a Shipment is only
concerned about the Shipping/Receiving activities, and not whether the
movement is done through a single truck that travels directly, or
through a series of LTL loads with intermediate cross-docking transfers.
Although this example is taken from common trucking operations, the
concept applies equally to automated transfer of goods within a
warehouse or international trade. The unit of shipment may be different,
but the focus on end-to-end movement of goods, and the identification of
those goods is what is important.

[]{#anchor-7}Transactions

Transactions are the commercial agreements that govern specific
exchanges of goods and their associated shipments. These agreements are
codified in well defined and regulated sets of documents with specific
legal responsibilities. Orders (sales and purchase), when settled,
represent the change of ownership of goods, BOL's and their lifecycle
represent the change of custody of the affected goods, etc...

[]{#anchor-8}Parties and Contracts

The final layer also represents commercial agreements between legal
entities (Parties), but in this case these agreements describe the
framework under which transactions are defined and executed. Contracts
may define terms and conditions of payment between two parties that
apply to all orders between them, etc... By extension, legal frameworks
that govern transactions in a jurisdiction would also be included in
this layer.
